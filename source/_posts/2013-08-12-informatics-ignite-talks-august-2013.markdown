After a very successful <a href="http://informatics.unep-wcmc.org/blog/blog/2012/12/12/informatics-ignite-talks-2012/">first edition of our ignite talks in December 2012</a>, 
we did it again last week.

This time around we had nine five minute talks. In these talks we
presented our latest projects, we covered of the
challenges faced in the development of IT projects, and we introduced 
ways to overcome the challenges and improve our processes.

<a href="https://coderwall.com/craigmmills">Craig Mills</a> opened the
session and talked about improving the quality of the tools developed in
our sector and how we should be passionate about what we do.

<a href="https://coderwall.com/deciob">Decio Battaglia</a> did the first
project related talk. He talked about a URL shortener that allows us to
share our work and track who is looking at it.

In our day to day work at UNEP-WCMC we always try to "change for the
better", to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen">Kaizen</a>.
In her talk <a href="https://coderwall.com/agnessa">Agnieszka Figiel</a>
explained how we can change for the better by taking advantage of slack
time.

In December 2012 <a href="https://coderwall.com/simaob">I</a> talked about the ISIP project.
In the meantime the project has been renamed Species+ and it's getting
closer to completion. In my talk I introduced the Species+ Website one of
the outputs of this project.

One other project that we have started developing in 2012 and we aim at
using in different future applications is named My Polygon and allows
users to draw polygons on top of web maps and obtain details about the
underlying layers. <a href="https://coderwall.com/migtorres">Miguel
Torres</a> our Geospatial Developer gave a talk about this project and
the how we made sure that we can provide the users with accurate results
in a very short amount of time.

content strategy, and its central role in the development of our
projects.

Anyone that develops software knows that bugs are inevitable.
Nevertheless there are ways to try to avoid them or as a last resort to
find them early on and fix them. <a
href="https://coderwall.com/adammulligan">Adam Mulligan</a> closed these
Ignites session talking about
different types of bugs and how do we handle them at UNEP-WCMC.

We really enjoyed preparing these talks, and we believe that it is very
important to show the work that we are developing and how we aim to
improve our processes. We are more than happy to answer any questions
that you might have, so feel free to leave a comment or send us an
email.

We hope to be back in the future with another edition of WCMC's
Informatics Ignite Talks!
