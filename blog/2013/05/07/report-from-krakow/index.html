<div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a good reason to visit Kraków any month of the year*, but this April was particularly abundant in tech events. During the two weeks of my stay there I was able to attend two international conferences and a workshop, all directly relevant to my work at WCMC. So here goes my mission report.</p>

<h2>Stop 1: <a href="http://aceconf.com/">ACE! Agile Central Europe</a></h2>


<p>The theme of this year&#8217;s edition of the Conference on Lean and Agile best practices was Kanban. The theme was tackled from different angles by the speakers, mostly from a high level perspective. A couple of my picks:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://vimeo.com/album/2358750/video/64712079">Dave Snowden - Applying Cynefin to Kanban</a>: everything in this presentation was new and captivating, starting from the inexplicable connection between the spelling and pronunciation of this Welsh word to the theory of complex adaptive systems.</li>

<li><a href="http://vimeo.com/album/2358750/video/64714047">Paweł Brodziński - Portfolio Kanban</a>: visualising work on portfolio level and applying WIP limits helps avoid context switching and improves transparency.</li>

<li><a href="http://vimeo.com/album/2358750/video/64706038">Andrea Provaglio - Dreaming</a>: good process ideas are not reserved to Toyota. I liked the Disney idea rooms and the proposition to keep a good proportion of &#8220;dreambits&#8221; in the project backlog.</li>

<li><a href="http://vimeo.com/album/2358750/video/64714843">Chris McDermott - The Other Side of Kanban</a>: respect for people is a principle which underpins Kanban. Use the innovative capabilities of all people in an organisation.</li>

<li><a href="http://vimeo.com/album/2358750/video/65115852">Matt Philip - Agile QA 2.0</a>: an extremely convincing take on establishing QA in an agile team throughout the development process, as opposed to &#8220;the last column on the Kanban board&#8221;.</li>
</ul>


<p><img class="left" src="/blog/images/report_from_krakow/ace2013_board.jpg" width="250" title="I know about vs I'd like to learn about board" >
<img src="/blog/images/report_from_krakow/ace2013_openspaces.jpg" width="250" title="Timetable of openspace sessions" ></p>

<p>On both days there were open space sessions, where you could choose to join and leave discussions around previously announced topics. Unfortunately, I was disappointed to see many of the open spaces running in Polish. It&#8217;s a shame to exclude many international guests this way. Topics ranged from developer-oriented (&#8220;human factor in code reviews&#8221;) to manager-oriented (&#8220;team motivation in a long running project&#8221;). My favourite was hosted by <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisvmcd">Chris McDermott</a>, where we discussed different aspects of respect in the <a href="http://limitedwipsociety.ning.com/page/lean-coffee">lean coffee</a> format.</p>

<p>And BTW, the &#8220;5 why&#8217;s&#8221; tshirt design sets the bar high for conference swag!</p>

<h2>Stop 2: <a href="http://railsgirls.com/krakow2013">RailsGirls Kraków</a></h2>


<p>RailsGirls is a wildly popular global event, which originated in Finland in 2010. The goal is to encourage women to enter the field of technology in order to bridge the gender gap. The idea is that experienced programmers volunteer to coach beginners and help them build their first web application during a one day workshop.</p>




<p>This was already the second edition of the event in Kraków, first one for me. It was organised by the <a href="http://webmus.es/">Webmuses</a> community and apparently the demand exceeded capacity not only in terms of participants (3 per place) but also coaches. We started with an installation party followed by a clever robot game proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/dira_geek_girl">Irina Dumitrascu</a> - the task was to write a program that guides a robot through a maze. Given that the robots were substituted by coaches and that their task was to execute the program inclusive of signalling error conditions, that had to be a success.</p>




<p>The following day the actual coding started. I coached a group of three very curious and determined women. They asked a lot of good questions and did a brilliant job working on their app. I&#8217;d recommend coaching beginners as a great excercise to anyone who thinks they know anything about whatever - try to explain that to someone who doesn&#8217;t have a clue!</a>

<h2>Stop 3: <a href="http://www.railsberry.com/">Railsberry</a></h2>
<p>The European Rails conference, or conference for curious developers, was the second edition of a spectacular event last year. Think balloons, sun chairs, modern dance performance, extremely well designed and consistent graphics, animations and decorations inside and outside the venue.</p>

<p>The venue! It was a 100-year-old horse tram depot in the historic district of Kazimierz. Old tram rails still leading into the entrance gate (rails, ha! finally I crafted a pun, took me over a year of living in England) and a giant pink unicorn to intimidate passers-by. The best variety swag out there - I scored a pair of <a href="http://unerdwear.com/">nerdies</a> and a Go gopher in addition to the rich contents of my speaker&#8217;s bag, but some people out there were able to collect up to three additional tshirts :)</p>

<p></p>
<p>Getting to the point, the talks were pretty good as well :) My personal favourites:</p>
<ul>
<li>Joseph Wilk Creative Machines - very clever AI machines that draw pictures, compose music and write poetry. An amazingly insightful talk into what we consider creativity and how the role of the unconscious can be better understood through AI.</li>
<li>Andrew Gerrand Go: a simple programming environment - might sound repulsive from a ruby developer, but I&#8217;d really like some data types and pointers at my hands. <a href="https://twitter.com/enneff">Andrew Gerrand</a> highlighted some of the aspects of Go and emphasized its simplicity. And brought a box full of Go gophers :)</li>
<li>Felix Geisendoerfer Programming flying robots with JavaScript - I think it was my original intention to learn programming in order to program a robot, as I could hardly see why else one would go into the trouble. I wish I had pursued that original idea, as it was clearly an early illumination. Programming flying drones seems incomparably more attractive to whatever else you can program.</li>
</ul>

<p>I gave a talk on the first day of the conference about PostgreSQL in context of the database of endangered species, which is one of the biggest projects we&#8217;re working on at the moment at WCMC. I wanted to share my excitement about the advanced features of PostgreSQL that we applied to the taxonomic component of our database, namely recursive CTEs and windowing functions. Speaking in front of this amazing crowd was an ultimate adrenaline rush. I was extremely pleased with the reactions I received and the really good questions people asked afterwards.</p>

<p>On both days of the conference there were lightning talk sessions, which were very rigorously timed by a team armed with a vuvuzela and a speaker-bazooka. Our own CRUG colleague Andrew France made it though!</p>

<p>On the whole, the quality and diversity of Kraków-based events are increasing so rapidly that even as a native I cannot help but be in awe of the potential therein. Well done people!</p>

<p>* Kraków is my home town. I&#8217;m not accepting criticism on that claim.</p>
