    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After a very successful <a href="http://informatics.unep-wcmc.org/blog/blog/2012/12/12/informatics-ignite-talks-2012/">first edition of our ignite talks in December 2012</a>,
we did it again last week.</p>

<p>This time around we had nine five minute talks. In these talks we
presented our latest projects, we covered the
challenges faced in the development of IT projects, and we introduced
ways to overcome the challenges and improve our processes.</p>

<p><a href="https://coderwall.com/craigmmills">Craig Mills</a> opened the
session and talked about improving the quality of the tools developed in
our sector and how we should be passionate about what we do.</p>

</p>


<p><a href="https://coderwall.com/deciob">Decio Battaglia</a> did the first
project related talk. He talked about a URL shortener that allows us to
share our work and track who is looking at it.</p>

</p>


<p>Next up was <a href="https://coderwall.com/timwilkinson">Tim Wilkinson</a> who talked
about the challenges of estimation
and how we go about doing it at UNEP-WCMC with agile planning.</p>

<p>The National Reporting Toolkit is one of our most recent projects and <a
href="https://coderwall.com/th3james">James Cox</a> introduced it to our
colleagues at UNEP-WCMC.</p>

<p>In our day to day work at UNEP-WCMC we always try to "change for the
better", to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen">Kaizen</a>.
In her talk <a href="https://coderwall.com/agnessa">Agnieszka Figiel</a>
explained how we can change for the better by taking advantage of slack
time.</p>

<p>In December 2012 <a href="https://coderwall.com/simaob">I</a> talked about the ISIP project.
In the meantime the project has been renamed Species+ and it's getting
closer to completion. In my talk I introduced the Species+ Website one of
the outputs of this project.</p>

<p>One other project that we have started developing in 2012 and we aim at
using in different future applications is named My Polygon and allows
users to draw polygons on top of web maps and obtain details about the
underlying layers. <a href="https://coderwall.com/migtorres">Miguel
Torres</a> our Geospatial Developer gave a talk about this project and
the how we made sure that we can provide the users with accurate results
in a very short amount of time.</p>

</p>


<p><a href="https://coderwall.com/blancatortajada">Blanca Tortajada
Perez</a>, our designer in Informatics talked about the importance of
content strategy, and its central role in the development of our
projects.</p>

<p>Anyone that develops software knows that bugs are inevitable.
Nevertheless there are ways to try to avoid them or as a last resort to
find them early on and fix them. <a
href="https://coderwall.com/adammulligan">Adam Mulligan</a> closed these
Ignite sessions talking about
different types of bugs and how we handle them at UNEP-WCMC.</p>

<p>

</p>


<p>We really enjoyed preparing these talks, and we believe that it is very
important to show the work that we are developing and how we aim to
improve our processes. We are more than happy to answer any questions
that you might have, so feel free to leave a comment or send us an
email.</p>

<p>We hope to be back in the future with another edition of WCMC's
Informatics Ignite Talks!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On the 11th of December 2012 our team prepared a series of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignite_(event)">Ignite Talks</a>
to show our colleagues at UNEP-WCMC the work that we are doing and how
we go about doing it.</p>

<p>The session started with a talk by our Head of Programme, <a
href="https://coderwall.com/craigmmills">Craig Mills</a>.
He talked about our team and work in 2012.</p>

</p>


<p>Next up was <a href="https://coderwall.com/agnessa">Agnieszka Figiel</a> one
of our Ruby on Rails Developers. Agnieszka explained how we go about
delivering excelence.</p>

<p><a href="https://coderwall.com/simaob">I</a> followed Agnieszka and talked about one of the big projects that we
started in 2012, the Integrated Species Information Platform. A project
that is focused in the redevelopment of the species databases maitained
at UNEP-WCMC, and the creation of new bespoke public facing interfaces
to explore that data.</p>

</p>


<p><a href="https://coderwall.com/th3james">James Cox</a> talked about the <a
href="http://apesportal.eva.mpg.de/status/tools/dashboard">A.P.E.S. Dashboard</a>.
This web application was developed in BackboneJS in early 2012 and is a way
for Governments to decide where to invest their money to protect great
apes.</p>

</p>


<p><a href="https://coderwall.com/decioferreira">DÃ©cio Ferreira</a> talked
about the <a href="http://reddplusdatabase.org/">Voluntary REDD+ Database</a>.
A tool to provide information to the global community on <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_REDD_Programme">REDD+</a>
financing, actions and results, providing the ability to search,
summarise and visualize data. (Unfortunately his talk is not yet
available online).</p>

</p>


<p>The last talk of this Ignite Session was done by <a
href="https://coderwall.com/timwilkinson">Tim Wilkinson</a>. Tim talked
about the Abu Dhabi Blue Carbon project, our first iPad App. This
application allows scientist to measure the carbon sequestered by
coastal habitats like mangroves, seagrass, and others. Data can be
collected off-line and then syncronised back into a web server.</p>

</p>


<p>After Tim's talk Craig Mills has closed the session with a quick glimpse
into the year of 2013.</p>

<p><strong>Ignite Talks:</strong> each of our talks lasted for 5 minutes
  and consisted of 20 slides that transitioned automatically after 15
seconds.</p>
